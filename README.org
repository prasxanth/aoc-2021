** Solutions

- [[https://prasxanth.github.io/aoc-2021/][Github pages]]
- [[https://github.com/prasxanth/aoc-2021/blob/main/solutions.org][Org document]]
- [[https://github.com/prasxanth/aoc-2021/tree/main/src][Source]] 
  - All source code tangled from the Org document
  - Comments, assertions and empty lines are removed using the =compijs.sh= bash script
  - All files have =getin=, =part1= and =part2= functions. Assuming =ifn= is the input filename, the solution for each part is obtained as =part1 (getin ifn)= and =part2 (getin ifn)=.
